  {
    question: "Do I need a technical background for prompt engineering?",
    answer: "Not at all. Anyone can write a prompt. This course is designed for everyone, from writers and marketers to developers and entrepreneurs. The key skill is clear communication, not coding."
  },
  {
    question: "Is 'zero-shot' or 'few-shot' prompting better?",
    answer: "It depends on the task. Start with zero-shot for simple, direct tasks. If the output isn't quite right or you need a specific format, add one or more examples (one-shot or few-shot) to guide the model. For complex reasoning, few-shot with Chain of Thought is very powerful."
  },
  {
    question: "What is 'temperature' and how should I use it?",
    answer: "Temperature controls the randomness of the output. For factual, predictable answers (like extraction or classification), use a low temperature (e.g., 0.1-0.2). For creative tasks like brainstorming or writing stories, use a higher temperature (e.g., 0.7-1.0) to get more diverse results."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is providing context so important?",
    answer: "Context is everything. An LLM without context is just a powerful prediction engine. By providing context, like a persona for the AI, background information, or examples, you narrow down the infinite possibilities and guide the model toward the specific, high-quality output you need."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use prompt engineering to generate code?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Prompt engineering is extremely effective for coding tasks. You can ask an LLM to write functions, explain complex code, translate between languages, and even debug errors. Module 4 of this course is dedicated entirely to code prompting."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I avoid getting generic or wrong answers?",
    answer: "Be specific. The more detailed your instructions, the better the output. Use the techniques in this course: give examples, define a role for the AI, provide context, and clearly state your desired output format (like JSON or a bulleted list). Don't be afraid to iterate and refine your prompt."

                                <p>At its core, a Large Language Model (LLM) is a powerful prediction engine. It takes a sequence of text (your prompt) and predicts the most likely next word, token by token. Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing high-quality prompts that guide the LLM to produce accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.</p>
                                <p>You don't need to be a data scientist. Your job is not to build the model, but to communicate with it effectively. A well-crafted prompt can be the difference between a generic, useless response and a brilliant, insightful one.</p>

                                <p>Beyond the words you write, you can control the AI's output with a few key settings:</p>
                                <ul className="my-6">
                                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Controls randomness. Low temperature (e.g., 0.2) is deterministic and good for factual answers. High temperature (e.g., 0.9) is more creative and good for brainstorming.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Max Output Tokens:</strong> Limits the length of the response. This is crucial for controlling costs and ensuring responses are concise.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Top-K and Top-P:</strong> These settings control the sampling of tokens. Top-K limits the model to the 'K' most likely next tokens. Top-P (nucleus sampling) selects from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds 'P'. They provide another way to tune the creativity versus predictability of the model.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>As a general starting point, a temperature of 0.2, Top-P of 0.95, and Top-K of 40 will give you coherent, safe results. For creative tasks, try a temperature of 0.9.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Few-Shot:</strong> You provide multiple examples (usually 3-5). This is highly effective for complex tasks or when you need the model to follow a very specific pattern. The more examples you provide, the better the model understands your intent.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Role Prompting:</strong> You assign a specific persona to the AI. This is incredibly powerful for controlling the tone, style, and expertise of the response. <br/> <i>Example: "You are a world-class travel guide. Suggest three places to visit in Tokyo."</i></li>
                                    <li><strong>System Prompting:</strong> You provide overarching instructions that define the AI's purpose or constraints. <br/> <i>Example: "You are a helpful assistant. Only return your answer in JSON format."</i></li>
                                    <li><strong>Contextual Prompting:</strong> You give the AI specific background information relevant to the task. This helps the model generate a more tailored and accurate response. <br/> <i>Example: "Context: The user is writing for a blog about retro 80s video games. Suggest three article topics."</i></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Combining these techniques is key. A great prompt might assign a role, provide context, and give a few-shot example all at once.</p>
