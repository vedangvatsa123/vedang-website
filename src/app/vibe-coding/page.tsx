const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "Do I need to know how to code at all?",
    answer: "Not to get started. The tools are designed to work with plain English. However, understanding basic HTML and CSS concepts will help you communicate more effectively with the AI. You'll naturally pick up these concepts as you build."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this 'real' programming?",
    answer: "Yes. You are creating real, production-quality code. The only thing that's changed is the interface. Instead of typing code, you are describing it. The end result is the same: a functional software application. Your role shifts from a 'coder' to a 'technical director.'"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I build complex applications with this method?",
    answer: "Yes. You can build complex applications with multi-step workflows, databases, and integrations. Break down the complexity into manageable parts and guide the AI step-by-step, just as a project manager would guide a development team."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the biggest mistakes beginners make?",
    answer: "The biggest mistake is giving vague, one-shot prompts like 'build me a social media app.' Vibe coding is a conversation. The second biggest mistake is not using version control ('Checkpoints'). You must save your progress after every successful step, because the AI will occasionally make mistakes."
  },
  {
    question: "Which tool should I start with?",
    answer: "If you're a visual person and want to build a web app, start with Lovable.dev. If you're more interested in logic, bots, or backend services, start with Replit. Both are excellent for beginners because they require zero setup. Firebase Studio is fantastic when you're ready to build something that can scale to a large audience."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I handle errors and bugs?",
    answer: "Your new job isn't to fix the bug, but to report it correctly. When you get an error message, copy the entire message, paste it back to the AI, and say, 'We have an error, please fix this.' 9 times out of 10, the AI will understand and correct its own mistake."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell the apps I build?",
    answer: "Yes! You own the code and the final product. People are already building successful SaaS businesses, freelance careers, and agencies using Vibe Coding. Your ability to build and iterate quickly is a massive competitive advantage."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my job as a developer at risk?",
    answer: "No, but it is changing. Your value is shifting from writing boilerplate code to high-level architecture, system design, and product vision. Developers who embrace Vibe Coding become 10x more productive."
  },
  {
    question: "What about security and privacy?",
    answer: "This is critical. You are still responsible for the final code. You must instruct the AI on security best practices, such as never hard-coding API keys and always hashing user passwords. In Module 5, we cover how to create a 'rules' file to enforce these policies automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I learn more?",
    answer: "This course is your starting point. The best way to learn is by building. Pick a small project and build it with one of the tools mentioned. Follow people like Andrej Karpathy and other Vibe Coders on social media to see what's possible. The community is the best resource."

It describes a new way for humans and machines to work together. Instead of writing code line-by-line, you describe your goal in plain language, and the AI generates the app. Your job changes. You are less like a coder who writes code, and more like a director who guides the project.</p>

                                <p>Never start a project with an empty chat. You need a plan. In product management, this plan is called a PRD. For us, it is a simple text file that tells the AI exactly what to build. It is like a blueprint for a house.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> What problem are you solving? Who has this problem? (e.g., "Busy people forget to drink water.")</li>
                                    <li><strong>Users:</strong> A short description of your ideal user. (e.g., "Sarah, a 30-year-old manager who works from home.")</li>
                                    <li><strong>Features:</strong> A list of the most important features. (e.g., "User signup/login," "Set daily water goal," "Log water," "Send reminders.")</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Model:</strong> How will you store information? (e.g., "A `users` table with email and password. A `water_logs` table with user_id and amount.")</li>
                                    <li><strong>What Not to Build:</strong> What will you NOT build in the first version? (e.g., "No social features," "No integrations.")</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>A Useful Trick:</strong> You can use one AI to help you make a plan for another AI. For example, you can prompt a powerful model like <Link href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude</Link> or <Link href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</Link> with this:</p>
                                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary/50 pl-4 italic my-4">"You are an expert product manager. I want to build a [Recipe App for users with food allergies]. Ask me questions to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD)."</blockquote>
                                <p>The AI will ask you questions to help you think about all the details. The final document becomes the main prompt for your project.</p>

                                <p>Vibe coding is a conversation, not a single command. Good products are made by making small changes over time. It’s like sculpting: you start with a block and slowly shape it. Nobody gets it perfect on the first try.</p>

                                  </li>
                                  <li>

                                <p>Building fast can create security problems. The AI is like a junior developer; it does not know your security rules. You must be the senior developer who sets the rules. This is very important for professional vibe coding.</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> An AI might put your private API keys in public code. It might create a login page that is not secure. It does not know what is secret unless you tell it.</li>
                                  <li><strong>The Fix: The Rule File.</strong> Most AI coding tools let you create a special file (like `.cursorrules` or `CLAUDE.md`) with permanent instructions. You must create one.
                                    <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary/50 pl-4 italic my-4">
                                    <strong>Rule #1 (Secrets):</strong> Always use environment variables for secret keys. Never write them directly in the code. Call them using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.<br/><br/>
                                    <strong>Rule #2 (Passwords):</strong> All user passwords must be securely hashed (encrypted) before you store them. Never store passwords as plain text.<br/><br/>
                                    <strong>Rule #3 (Database Access):</strong> Always check data on the server side. Use your platform's security rules (like Firebase Security Rules or Supabase RLS) to protect data. Do not only rely on checks in the browser, because they can be skipped.
                                    </blockquote>

                                <p>Setting these rules at the start helps the AI build safely for you. This makes it a trusted partner, not a risk.</p>

                                <p>How do you turn your app into a business? Vibe coding makes it faster than ever because it costs less to try new ideas. You can test ideas in a weekend that used to take months.</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>SaaS (Software as a Service):</strong> This is the most common way. Do not try to build a huge app like Facebook. Instead, build a tool that solves a specific problem for a small group of people. For example, build a "Meal Planner for Vegan Athletes" and charge $10 per month. You can add payment tools like <Link href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</Link> with simple prompts.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Freelancing and Consulting:</strong> Your new skill is speed. You can build apps for clients much faster than a traditional developer. You can market yourself as someone who builds prototypes quickly. Building a client's first version in days, not months, is very valuable.</li>
                                   <li><strong>Marketplace Apps & Plugins:</strong> Build an app for a store like the <Link href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code Marketplace</Link>, <Link href="https://apps.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify App Store</Link>, or <Link href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Workspace Marketplace</Link>. These platforms already have users and payment systems, which solves two of the hardest problems for a new product.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It has never been easier to start a business. With Vibe Coding, one person with a good idea can build a successful business from home.</p>
